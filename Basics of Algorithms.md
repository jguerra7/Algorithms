# Algorithm Basics
Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. 
Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, 
i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.

## Why Study Algorithms?
It’s a set of well-defined rules—a recipe, in effect—for solving some computational problem. 
Maybe you have a bunch of numbers and you want to rearrange them so that
they’re in sorted order. Maybe you have a road map and you want
to compute the shortest path from some origin to some destination.
Maybe you need to complete several tasks before certain deadlines,
and you want to know in what order you should finish the tasks so
that you complete them all by their respective deadlines.

## So why study algorithms?
Important for all other branches of computer science. First,
understanding the basics of algorithms and the closely related field
of data structures is essential for doing serious work in pretty much
any branch of computer science.

## Driver of technological innovation

Second, algorithms play a key role in modern technological innovation. 
To give just one obvious example, search engines use a tapestry of algorithms to efficiently
compute the relevance of various Web pages to a given search query.
The most famous such algorithm is the PageRank algorithm currently
in use by Google. Indeed, in a December 2010 report to the United
States White House, the President’s council of advisers on science
and technology wrote the following:

```
“Everyone knows Moore’s Law –– a prediction made in
1965 by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the density
of transistors in integrated circuits would continue to
double every 1 to 2 years. . . in many areas, performance
gains due to improvements in algorithms have vastly
exceeded even the dramatic performance gains due to
increased processor speed.”
(Excerpt from Report to the President and Congress: Designing a Digital
Future, December 2010 (page 71).
```

## Example of an Algorithm?
Let us consider the problem of preparing an omelette. To prepare an omelette, we follow the steps given below:
```
1) Get the frying pan.
2) Get the oil.
	a. Do we have oil?
		i. If yes, put it in the pan.
		ii. If no, do we want to buy oil?
			1. If yes, then go out and buy.
			2. If no, we can terminate.
3) Turn on the stove, etc...
```

What we are doing is, for a given problem (preparing an omelette), we are providing a step-bystep
procedure for solving it. The formal definition of an algorithm can be stated as:

An algorithm is the step-by-step unambiguous instructions to solve a given problem.

> In the traditional study of algorithms, there are two main criteria for judging the merits of
algorithms: correctness (does the algorithm give solution to the problem in a finite number of
steps?) and efficiency (how much resources (in terms of memory and time) does it take to execute
it).
