# Algorithm Basics
Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. 
Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, 
i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.

## Why Study Algorithms?
It’s a set of well-defined rules—a recipe, in effect—for solving some computational problem. 
Maybe you have a bunch of numbers and you want to rearrange them so that
they’re in sorted order. Maybe you have a road map and you want
to compute the shortest path from some origin to some destination.
Maybe you need to complete several tasks before certain deadlines,
and you want to know in what order you should finish the tasks so
that you complete them all by their respective deadlines.

## So why study algorithms?
Important for all other branches of computer science. First,
understanding the basics of algorithms and the closely related field
of data structures is essential for doing serious work in pretty much
any branch of computer science.

## Driver of technological innovation

Second, algorithms play a key role in modern technological innovation. 
To give just one obvious example, search engines use a tapestry of algorithms to efficiently
compute the relevance of various Web pages to a given search query.
The most famous such algorithm is the PageRank algorithm currently
in use by Google. Indeed, in a December 2010 report to the United
States White House, the President’s council of advisers on science
and technology wrote the following:

```
“Everyone knows Moore’s Law –– a prediction made in
1965 by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the density
of transistors in integrated circuits would continue to
double every 1 to 2 years. . . in many areas, performance
gains due to improvements in algorithms have vastly
exceeded even the dramatic performance gains due to
increased processor speed.”
(Excerpt from Report to the President and Congress: Designing a Digital
Future, December 2010 (page 71).
