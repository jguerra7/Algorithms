# PseudoCode Performance Labs:

Designing Your First Program
Sometimes, as a beginning student, you might have trouble getting started with a programming
problem. In these performance labs you are presented with simple problems, go through the
process of analyzing the program’s requirements, and design the algorithm in
pseudocode. 

## Here are the programming problems:
## 1. Batting Average

```
In baseball, batting average is commonly used to measure a player’s batting ability. You
use the following formula to calculate a player’s batting average:
Batting Average = Hits ÷ Times at Bat
In the formula, Hits is the number of successful hits made by the player, and Times at
Bat is the number of times the player was at bat. For example, if a player is at bat 500
times during a season, and gets 150 hits, that player’s batting average is .300. Design a
program to calculate any player’s batting average.
```
## 2. Sales Prediction
```

A company has determined that its annual profit is typically 23 percent of total
sales. Design a program that asks the user to enter the projected amount of total
sales, and then displays the profit that will be made from that amount.
Hint: Use the value 0.23 to represent 23 percent.
```
## 3. Land Calculation
```

One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. Design a program that asks
the user to enter the total square feet in a tract of land and calculates the number
of acres in the tract.
```
>Hint: Divide the amount entered by 43,560 to get the number of acres.
## 4. Total Purchase
```
A customer in a store is purchasing five items. Design a program that asks for the
price of each item, and then displays the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales
tax, and the total. Assume the sales tax is 6 percent.
```
## 5. Distance Traveled
```

Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the
interstate can be calculated with the following formula:

>Distance = Speed × Time

A car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. Design a program that displays the following:
● The distance the car will travel in 5 hours
● The distance the car will travel in 8 hours
● The distance the car will travel in 12 hours
```
