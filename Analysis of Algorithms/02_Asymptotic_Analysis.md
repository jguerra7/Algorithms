# Asymptotic Analysis
In mathematical analysis, asymptotic analysis of algorithm is a method of defining the mathematical boundation of its run-time performance. Using the asymptotic analysis, we can easily conclude about the average case, best case and worst case scenario of an algorithm.

It is used to mathematically calculate the running time of any operation inside an algorithm.

> Example: Running time of one operation is x(n) and for another operation it is calculated as f(n2). It refers to running time will increase linearly with increase in 'n' for first operation and running time will increase exponentially for second operation. Similarly the running time of both operations will be same if n is significantly small.

## Usually the time required by an algorithm comes under three types:

- Worst case: It defines the input for which the algorithm takes the huge time.

- Average case: It takes average time for the program execution.

- Best case: It defines the input for which the algorithm takes the lowest time.
