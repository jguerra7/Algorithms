# INTRODUCTION
We will explain the concept of arrays using an analogy. Consider a situation in which we have
20 students in a class and we have been asked to write a program that reads and prints the marks
of all the 20 students. In this program, we will need 20 integer variables with different names.

Now to read the values of these 20 variables, we must have 20 read statements. Similarly, to print
the value of these variables, we need 20 write statements. If it is just a matter of 20 variables, then
it might be acceptable for the user to follow this approach. But would it be possible to follow this
approach if we have to read and print the marks of students,
```
Σ in the entire course (say 100 students)
Σ in the entire college (say 500 students)
Σ in the entire university (say 10,000 students)
```
>The answer is no, definitely not! To process a large amount of data, we need a data structure
known as array.

An array is a collection of similar data elements. These data elements have the same data type.
The elements of the array are stored in consecutive memory locations and are referenced by an
index (also known as the subscript). The subscript is an ordinal number which is used to identify
an element of the array.
