# Heap is a special case of balanced binary tree data structure where the root-node key 
is compared with its children and arranged accordingly. If α has child node β then −
```
key(α) ≥ key(β)
```
As the value of parent is greater than that of child, this property generates Max Heap.
Based on this criteria, a heap can be of two types −

> For Input → 35 33 42 10 14 19 27 44 26 31

Min-Heap − Where the value of the root node is less than or equal to either of its children.

Max-Heap − Where the value of the root node is greater than or equal to either of its children.
