# Demonstration Labs continued:
## Write a program that inputs a line of text and uses a stack to print the line reversed.
  ### Expected Output:
  ```
  Enter a line of text:
this is a line of text

The line is reverse is:
txet fo enil a si siht
```
## (Palindrome Tester) Write a program that uses a stack to determine if a string is a palindrome
(i.e., the string is spelled identically backward and forward). The program should ignore
spaces and punctuation.

### Expected Output:
```
Enter a line of text:
able was i ere i saw elba
"able was i ere i saw elba" is a palindrome

Enter a line of text:
this is not a palindrome
"this is not a palindrome" is not a palindrome
```
