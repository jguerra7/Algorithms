# Linked List Examples

A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called head. If the linked list is empty, then value of head is NULL.
Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:
```
1) data
2) Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node
```
In C, we can represent a node using structures. Below is an example of a linked list node with an integer data.

Example of linked list node
```C
// A linked list node 
struct Node 
{ 
  int data; 
  struct Node *next; 
}; 
```
## First Simple Linked List in C Let us create a simple linked list with 3 nodes

```C
// A simple C program to introduce 
// a linked list 
#include<stdio.h> 
#include<stdlib.h> 
  
struct Node  
{ 
  int data; 
  struct Node *next; 
}; 
  
// Program to create a simple linked  
// list with 3 nodes 
int main() 
{ 
  struct Node* head = NULL; 
  struct Node* second = NULL; 
  struct Node* third = NULL; 
    
  // allocate 3 nodes in the heap   
  head = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));  
  second = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node)); 
  third = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node)); 
  
  /* Three blocks have been allocated  dynamically.  
     We have pointers to these three blocks as first, 
     second and third      
       head           second           third 
        |                |               | 
        |                |               | 
    +---+-----+     +----+----+     +----+----+ 
    | #  | #  |     | #  | #  |     |  # |  # | 
    +---+-----+     +----+----+     +----+----+ 
     
   # represents any random value. 
   Data is random because we havenâ€™t assigned  
   anything yet  */
    
  head->data = 1; //assign data in first node 
  head->next = second; // Link first node with  
                       // the second node 
    
  /* data has been assigned to data part of first 
     block (block pointed by head).  And next 
     pointer of first block points to second.   
     So they both are linked. 
  
       head          second         third 
        |              |              | 
        |              |              | 
    +---+---+     +----+----+     +-----+----+ 
    | 1  | o----->| #  | #  |     |  #  | #  | 
    +---+---+     +----+----+     +-----+----+     
  */  
    
  // assign data to second node  
  second->data = 2;  
  
  // Link second node with the third node 
  second->next = third; 
    
  /* data has been assigned to data part of second 
     block (block pointed by second). And next 
     pointer of the second block points to third  
     block. So all three blocks are linked. 
    
       head         second         third 
        |             |             | 
        |             |             | 
    +---+---+     +---+---+     +----+----+ 
    | 1  | o----->| 2 | o-----> |  # |  # | 
    +---+---+     +---+---+     +----+----+      */    
    
  third->data = 3; //assign data to third node 
  third->next = NULL; 
    
  /* data has been assigned to data part of third 
    block (block pointed by third). And next pointer 
    of the third block is made NULL to indicate 
    that the linked list is terminated here. 
  
     We have the linked list ready.   
  
           head     
             | 
             |  
        +---+---+     +---+---+       +----+------+ 
        | 1  | o----->|  2  | o-----> |  3 | NULL | 
        +---+---+     +---+---+       +----+------+        
     
      
    Note that only head is sufficient to represent  
    the whole list.  We can traverse the complete  
    list by following next pointers.    */
